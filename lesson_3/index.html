			<h1>introduction</h1>
			<p>On smaller brochure sites, how you organize your styles isn’t usually a big concern. You get in there, write
				some CSS, or maybe even some SASS. You compile it all into a single stylesheet with SASS’s production
				settings, and then you aggregate it to get all the stylesheets from modules into a nice tidy package.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>However, when it comes to larger, more complex projects, how you organize your code is the key to efficiency
				in at least these three ways: it affects how long it takes you to write code, how much of that code you’ll
				have to write and how much loading your browser will have to do. This becomes especially important when
				you’re working with teams of themers, and when high performance is essential.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>This is also true for long-term projects with legacy code <a

				and BEM mixing in there).</p>

			<h2>Methodologies</h2>
			<p>There are plenty of <a
					href="https://github.com/awesome-css-group/awesome-css#naming-conventions--methodologies-bulb"
					target="_blank">methodologies</a> out there aiming to reduce the CSS footprint, organize cooperation
				among programmers and maintain large CSS codebases. This is obvious in large projects like Twitter, Facebook
				and GitHub, but other projects often grow into some “Huge CSS file” state pretty quickly.</p>

			<h2>Why BEM over the others?</h2>
			<p>No matter what methodology you choose to use in your projects, you will benefit from the advantages of more
				structured CSS and UI. Some styles are less strict and more flexible, while others are easier to understand
				and adapt in a team.</p>

			<blockquote>The reason I choose BEM over other methodologies comes down to this: it is less confusing than the
				other methods (i.e. SMACSS) but still provides us the good architecture we want (i.e. OOCSS) and with a
				recognizable terminology. - Mark McDonnell, Maintainable CSS with BEM</blockquote>
